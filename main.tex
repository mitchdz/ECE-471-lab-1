\section{Overview}

The learning objective of this lab is for students to get familiar with the concepts in the secret-key encryption. After finishing the lab, students should be able to gain a first-hand experience on encryption algorithms, encryption modes, paddings, and initial vector (IV). Moreover, students will be able to use tools and write programs to encrypt/decrypt messages. This lab covers the following topics:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Secret-key encryption
        \item Substitution cipher and frequency analysis
        \item Encryption modes and paddings
        \item Programming using the crypto library
    \end{itemize}

\textbf{Lab Environment}. This lab has been tested on our pre-built Ubuntu 12.04 VM and Ubuntu 16.04 VM, both of which can be downloaded from the SEED website.

\section{Lab Tasks}
\subsection{Task 1: Frequency Analysis Against Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher}
    
It is well-known that monoalphabetic substitution cipher (also known as monoalphabetic cipher) is not secure, because it can be subjected to frequency analysis. In this lab, you are given a cipher-text that is encrypted using a monoalphabetic cipher; namely, each letter in the original text is replaced by another letter, where the replacement does not vary (i.e., a letter is always replaced by the same letter during the encryption). Your job is to find out the original text using frequency analysis. It is known that the original text is an English article.
